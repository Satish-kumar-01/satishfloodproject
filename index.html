    <b><center>Every year,floods cause massive destruction in various regions,especiallyin Bihar and UP.People lose their homes,lives and livelihood due to lack of  timely warnings and preparation. Our idea is to develop an integrated Flood Survival Kit along with an AI-Based Early Warning System to help people prepare in advance and survive during floods</center></b>.</font>

<font font color="red" size="7"><b> Problem Statement:–</b></font>
<br>
<br>
<font><br><font size="5" color="yellow"><b>
    <center>Lack of Early Warnings – Many flood-prone areas do not have proper alert systems, making evacuation difficult.
    
    Unpreparedness – People often do not have access to necessary survival items like food, water, and first aid.
    
    Communication Barriers – During floods, power and mobile networks fail, making it hard to spread critical information.
    
    Property & Crop Damage – Farmers suffer huge losses as they are unaware of upcoming floods.
    
    
    Our solution addresses all these problems by providing both prevention (alerts) and preparedness (survival kit).</center>
